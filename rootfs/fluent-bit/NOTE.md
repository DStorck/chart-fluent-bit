These conf files are replaced by the ones in the chart.  
So make sure you do changes to the versions of these files in the chart, not here.

9/8/2018 - MLN - This build is NOT needed anymore.  We do not need to build special images, as we overload the conf files via the chart.   This also saves us from attempting to keep this Dockerfile in lockstep with the source fluent/fluent-bit repo.
